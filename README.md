secure_website
==============

<h4>Attempt to create a secure website considering OWASP standards</h4>

This code tries to defend the website against possible attacks of:<br/>
    SQL Injections<br/>
    Session Hijacking<br/>
    Cross Site Scripting<br/>
    Brute Force Attacks<br/>

It is achieved through Input/URL sanitization, encryption methods, a proper session start/stop/check, brute-force checking through time-stamps etc.

This is an implementation to learn how to secure-login based on a github project -
